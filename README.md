The slides for a presentation that gives an overview of Clojure to beginners.

LaTeX's Beamer package as well as some additional LaTeX packages were used to create the PDFs. See the `.tex` markup file's comments at the beginning for more information.

The PDF can be generated from the markup through `pdflatex`.  The TeX Live distribution on Mac OS X (installed through Macports) was used.
